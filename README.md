## ✨ Features

*   **🎨 Image Generation Mode:** Create new images from text prompts.
*   **🖌️ Image Editing Mode:** Modify existing images based on text prompts and optional masks.
*   **⚙️ Full API Parameter Control:** Access and adjust all relevant parameters supported by the OpenAI Images API directly through the UI (size, quality, output format, compression, background, moderation, number of images).
*   **🎭 Integrated Masking Tool:** Easily create or upload masks directly within the editing mode to specify areas for modification. Draw directly on the image to generate a mask.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the playground running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### 1. Set Up API Key

You need an OpenAI API key to use this application.

1.  If you don't have a `.env.local` file, create one.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

    **Important:** Keep your API key secret. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent accidental commits.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
# or
# pnpm install
# or
# bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
# or
# bun dev
```

### 4. Open the Playground

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. You should now be able to use the gpt-image-1 Playground!
